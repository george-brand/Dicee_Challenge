# dicee_challenge

This is a project from <b>Udemy - The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp</b>.  Dicee is a simple web application that allows a user to roll dice for 2 players
and identify the winner or a tie.  This application uses Java Script to generate a random number from 1 to 6 for each of the two dice and then display a dice image
corresponding to each number.  I published this application to [GitHub Pages](https://george-brand.github.io/dicee_challenge/) - just hit the *page reload* button in your browser to roll the dice!  I'm obviously rooting for Player 1. ðŸ˜€
